Observational Science and 
Dimensional Observers

Obeservational Relativity,
Standard Relativity,
Special Relativity,
Perspectives Relativity,

♾️. Time is infinite and
dynamicly discrete at intervals.
However, our life is short at times
and our memory is short at times.

00. Our specpective and bias
is like that of
a Light Cone in Time
Physics Dynamix where
time is being writen
through observation
or replay in light on Earth.

00a. Light is dimenstional and
other unseen observers will
see light and real objects
that we ourselves - as an
observable instrument -
observes the science to tell
us what is real.

f(x) = lm;
where l represents light
and mass and is an object in a 
materialistic manner if use.
l = (light)

m = (materialistic object
creation or spawn.)

f(x) = 2r;

where f of x is actual reality which
can only be viewed as material and
connected dimensionally fully expresed
through this explaination.

2 = A number guaranteed to
mark that we are 1 observor and
there is another observer which
changes physics, so 2 is chosen
however the true number is hidden
in the -o-; we draw a conclusion
that there exists another observer's 
perception and should include it.
therefor that is why the number 2
has been chosen.

r = (the little r.
our observable reality -o- with 
the unobservable realitiy of
the mind itself -i- )

f(x) = r = (i+R)/o

00b. Light in the imagination
can become real to imaginary,
unseen and conscious observers
in reality and memory and time.

i + R; where i is a real number
representing the observer's
imagination as a variable to include
and where R is the science observer's
visually seen materialistic world. 

i+R = the truest reality
including our imagination reality

i = (imagination reality variable;
a single real number we must include:
called the chaos variable.)

R = (reality what is firstly seen
by the self scientific observer)

o = (observers o observing reality; 
a number between 2 and more)

00c. This allows for divergent
realities exisiting in materialistic
memory based and mentally placed
divergent realities and memories.

o = a connection with an
additional observer who has
or has not a connected memory.

0. Accept that now is known,
written perhaps, a known
unknown or DeeJaVue repeat
destiny locked in time sometimes.

0a. An observor may think they
know exactly what will happen
in the future.

if f(x) is the future then
f(x) = O

1. The future is not known.

1a. However, patterns from past
can replay elsewhere in time.

f(x) = a number greater than 0
if it exists. so, 
past patterns = p; where p equals 
a direct connection to the past.

2. Memories

2a. Past memories existis in time
based on observations.

2b. An observer can have accessible
memories and divergent realities.

2c. Memories may become hard to tell
from thoughts and other divergent
memories.

2d. Divergent realities can exist in
memories of the event depending 
and requiring connections for
divergent realities to exist.

3. Time Tick

3a. There exists a time bottle neck
constrait and I call it Chronos
or the Time Tick, the Tick.

3b. Some can move anything inside
a time tick, or just a Tick.

3c. Everything possible happens
on the Tick.

4c. Imagination can create and
modify large amounts of data
on the Tick.
